#Flux calculation software
A program used to calculate stationary particle probability fluxes for two particles out of a trap.

As input, the program needs the vectors for the curves in k-space, the full eigensolutions to the single-particle Hamiltonian and the resonance 2-particle eigensolutions.

As output, the two-particle density map, flux map and total flux is obtained.
